# Design Thinking
*Design Thinking* is a non-linear methodology that can help you tackle complex design and development problems. The five stage approach is meant to be  flexible and is not always executed sequentially. Many steps will occur in parallel or will be repeated iteratively. The five stages cover understanding human needs, re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, brainstorming sessions, and hands-on prototype testing.

## The Five Stages
1. **Empathizing:** Understanding the human needs involved.
2. **Defining:** Re-framing and defining the problem in human-centric ways.
3. **Ideating:** Creating many ideas in ideation sessions.
4. **Prototyping:** Adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping.
5. **Testing:** Developing a prototype/solution to the problem.

## 1. Empathize
Developing empathy is an essential component the of human-centered design process. It helps developers set aside their own assumptions and gain insight into users needs.
- Gain an empathetic understanding of the problem you're trying to solve
- Consult experts about the area of concern
- Immerse yourself in the environment to develop deeper personal understanding of the issues involved
- Observe your audience and engage with them

## 2. Define (the Problem)
Defining the problem helps designers develop the right features and functions for the product. Helps set you up for the Ideation stage.
- Put together info you've gathered during empathize stage
- Analyze your observations
- Synthesize in order to identify core problems
- Define problem in human-centered manner

## 3. Ideate
This is when you start generating ideas based on your observations and analysis.
- Look for alternative ways to view the problem
- Try different Ideation techniques to stimulate free thinking sessions
- Write down as many ideas as possible

## 4. Prototype
An experimental phase that allows you to validate assumptions and iterate without wasting time developing features that users will not value.
- Experiment with ideas from ideation phase
- Use simple paper prototypes, scaled down version
- Share with team and some target users
- Either accept, improve, or ditch features based on the users experience

## 5. Test
Rigorously test the complete product.
- Distribute, observe, ask for feedback
- Make alterations and refinements
- Get ready for sprint and retrospective!
