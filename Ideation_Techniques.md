# Ideation Techniques
Some methods to spark free thinking.

### Brainstorming
Building good ideas from each other’s wild ideas.

### Brain-dumping
Like brainstorming, but done individually.

### Brain-writing
Like brainstorming, but everyone writes down and passes ideas for others to add to before discussing these.

### Brain-walking
Like brain-writing, but members walk about the room, adding to others’ ideas.

### Worst Possible Idea
Inverted brainstorming approach, emboldening more reserved individuals to produce bad ideas and yielding valuable threads.

### Challenging Assumptions
Overturning established beliefs about problems, revealing fresh perspectives.

### Mind-mapping
A graphical technique involving connecting ideas to problems’ major and minor qualities.

### Sketching/Sketch-storming
Using rough sketches/diagrams to express ideas/ potential solutions and explore the design space.

Developing a visual problem/ design/ solution-related story to illustrate a situation’s dynamics.

### SCAMPER
Questioning problems through action verbs (“Substitute”, “Combine”, “Adapt”, “Modify”, “Put to another use”, “Eliminate”, “Reverse”) to produce solutions.

### Body-storming
Role-playing in scenarios/customer-journey steps to find solutions.

### Analogies
Drawing comparisons to communicate ideas better.

### Provocation
Extreme lateral-thinking technique to challenge established beliefs and explore paths beyond.

### Movement
A “what if?” approach to overcoming obstacles in ideation and finding themes/ trends/attributes towards reliable solutions.

### Cheat-storm
Using previously ideated material as stimuli.

### Crowd-storming
Target audiences generate and validate ideas through feedback (e.g., social media) to provide valuable solution insights.

### Creative Pause
Taking time to pull back from obstacles.
