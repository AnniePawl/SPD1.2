# Visual Hierarchy

## Page Scanning Patterns
People typically read from the top down and from left to right. Page design incorporates this knowledge so people feel like they're intuitively navigating a page. Scanning patterns tend to take one of two shapes:
- **F-Patterns:** Apply to traditional, text-heavy pages (articles, blog posts)
- **Z-Patterns:** Apply to pages that aren't presented in traditional block text (websites, ads)

## Size: Go Big
**People read bigger things first.** Size is huge (lol) when it goes to visual hierarchy. It overrides most other hierarchy conventions like top-down.
    ### Try Using
    #### Three Different
    ##### Text Sizes

## Space & Texture
Another way of drawing attention to content is giving it texture or room to breath. Negative space is powerful.
- **Spacing** is an elegant alternative to the use of size or color  
- **Texture** refers to the overall arrangement or pattern of space, text, and other details on the page.

## Typeface Weight & Pairing
Typeface selection is critical! Typeface's have some important attributes to consider.
- **Font-weight:** the width of the stokes
- **Style:** serif, san-serif, italics, bold

## Color & Tint
Color has a lot of important, especially in mobile design, where small screen size limits use of other strategies. Try using color to accentuate important information
- Bright colors stand out!
- Lighter colors appear more distant

## Direction/ Position
Breaking the traditional grid layout can make certain elements standout. Text that's arranged around a curve or diagonal will automatically pop.
